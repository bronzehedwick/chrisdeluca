"Just frame it like, 'Let's see how much I can fail.'"

<!--more-->

I was sitting at a window table in a lower east side dive with a small group of
writers I had just met, questioning the ambition of my New Year's resolution.

The bar was packed with an earnest, ex-party-hardy Saturday night crowd,
chatting in large, homogeneous groups or milling around the pool table. Wrapped
in an almost defensive southwestern theme—cowboy boots hanging from the
ceiling, pop country on the jukebox whenever the internet radio algorithm
felt inclined—the place seemed like it was straining to make sure you knew how
relaxed it was.

The four of us were chatting about movies and music, I having been inserted
into their group by the social machinations of a mutual friend, who wasn't
present. Mercifully, we all hit it off.

As the topics slowly turned more personal, and we started trading life stories,
I began to unsubtly probe about writing. I had a creative writing degree, and
while I loved my job writing code, I often dreamed about writing prose. Or,
more accurately, I dreamed about getting my prose published. And these people,
well, they were *professional* writers.

Yet would pursuing writing more seriously actually be worth while? Would it be
the creatively satisfying experience I hoped, or the soul crushing wasteland I
feared? Or perhaps somewhere in between? I needed to be convinced.

I asked, "What's that freelance writing hustle like?"

The reply, "It sucks."

So does paying rent, I thought, and I still managed to do that every few
months. I was convinced: writing sounded fun.

Garth Brook's bubble-gum twang swayed in the background. I felt inspired, ready
to take on this new challenge.  In that moment I decided my New Year's
resolution had *not* been ambitious enough, and I would change it to, "Get
Writing Published," instead of, "Get A Yogurt."

I told the group as much, that I was going to make 2019 the year I got my
writing formally published. I just needed one thing ironed out.

"How do you handle rejection?"

I wasn't good with rejection, if anyone is. It was one of the top reasons I
hadn't submitted my writing more.

"Make a masochistic game out of it," a writer said. "Just frame it like, 'Let's
see how much I can fail.' Most people set a goal like getting rejected 100
times."

Re-framing the problem, _and_ collecting something? That appealed to the part
of me that loved creative solutions _and_ the part of me that used to collect
pistachio shells. It was the perfect solution.

So that is _exactly_ what I'm going to do: get 100 writing submissions rejected
in 2019.

Except 100 seems like a lot, so I'm cutting that in half. Come to think
of it, 50 *also* seems like a lot, so I'm cutting *that* in half. And
to be honest, I never liked the number 25, it seems like it would own a
diamond-encrusted iPhone. Since we're close, why not have one rejection
per month?

My final statement: This time next year I hope to have **12** articles
formally rejected by reputable publications.

I plan to post a round-up with short descriptions of all the ill-fated
articles.

Until then, I'm going to grab a yogurt.
