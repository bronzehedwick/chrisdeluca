**Zero Dark Thirty (2012)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790885/)

> The movie: Zero Dark Thirty. It's a good movie to see about how your country operates overseas and what it does to capture bin Laden. You heard about it but seeing it on the screen is much more shocking. I walked out of the theatre with my head spinning. Maybe because the movie ran 2.5 hours and I don't like sitting that long but probably more the thought that CIA people live on the edge all the time and it's hard to fanthom that kind of life. Definately a movie to see but don't expect to walk out of the theatre exhilorated.
