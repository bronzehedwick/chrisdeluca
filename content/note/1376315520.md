**Blue Jasmine (2013)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334873/)

> The movie: Blue Jazzmine. Woody Allen has  outdone himself on this one. I know certain people are fans of his and others are not but the material here has little to do with comedy and more to do with human  nature and people's inability to rise past life's crisis. Kate Blanchett plays the central character and does a   superb job. The rest of the cast is  terrific but half way into the movie it's apparent that Blanchett has the cental role and has the acting chops to take it on.  This movie is a must see.
