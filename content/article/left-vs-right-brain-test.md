I just took an online test to determine which side of the brain you favor, right or left. Here are my results:

## Right Brain/ Left Brain Quiz

The higher of these two numbers below indicates which side of your brain has dominance in your life. Realising your right brain/left brain tendency will help you interact with and to understand others.

<div>
  <strong>Left Brain Dominance:</strong> <meter value="5" min="1" max="10">Left Brain Dominance</meter> 5/10
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Right Brain Dominance:</strong> <meter value="5" min="1" max="10">Right Brain Dominance</meter> 5/10
</div>

What does this mean? Here&#8217;s the breakdown:

### Left Hemisphere Style

Draws on previously accumulated, organized information 

#### Rational

* Responds to verbal instructions
* Problem solves by logically and sequentially looking at the parts of things
* Looks at differences
* Is planned and structured
* Prefers established, certain information
* Prefers talking and writing
* Prefers multiple choice tests
* Controls feelings
* Prefers ranked authority structures

#### Sequential

* Is a splitter: distinction important
* Is logical, sees cause and effect

### Right Hemisphere Style

Draws on unbounded qualitative patterns that are not organized into sequences, but that cluster around images

#### Intuitive

* Responds to demonstrated instructions
* Problem solves with hunches, looking for patterns and configurations
* Looks at similarities
* Is fluid and spontaneous
* Prefers elusive, uncertain information
* Prefers drawing and manipulating objects
* Prefers open ended questions
* Free with feelings
* Prefers collegial authority structures

#### Simultaneous

* Is a lumper: connectedness important
* Is analogic, sees correspondences, resemblances
