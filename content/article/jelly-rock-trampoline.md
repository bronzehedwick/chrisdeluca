It's a investigation into types of brain modes for creativity and molding of that output. Jelly brain there is no filter whatsoever, and you're just throwing things directly out of your subconsciousness. Rock brain is very logical and can shape the work you've already done. Trampoline brain is something that I had a better handle on earlier, that I might have to think about more to regain. Something about a cross between the two, still being bound by gravity of the world, but being supernaturally (almost) able to defy it.
