**The Company You Keep (2012)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1381404/)

> The movie: The Company You Keep. The critics gave it a 6.3. I would give it a 7.5. The plot provided a fair amont of suspense. It featured a number of well known actors and heck we lived through this kind of stuff in the 60's and 70's.
