You are Manny Alvarez. You like playing baseball, playing bass, and not
getting pantsed.

You grew up in Washington Heights, your parents are both CPAs, and
Carlos Santana's _Supernatural_ album was a major event for your family.
Even _Shaman_ was pretty big.

Last year at camp, Matt Reichmann pantsed you seven times for, as he put
it, "standing like a wiener." It's only your second year at summer camp,
and if you get pantsed again this year, that will be your legacy forever.

You *cannot* get pantsed. If you get pantsed again, your life is over.

Don't get pantsed.

You're twelve.

---

You get out of your mom's beat up station wagon and breath in the heady
country air. It smells like cut grass and oxygen. Kids swarm center
meadow, the younger ones meeting their camp friends in chaotic bursts
of screamed half-sentences, the older ones slouching against the flag
pole, having found a perfect equilibrium with each other, seemingly
telepathically.

You just stand there.

You spot Dylan Cizinski, an alarmingly optimistic kid who didn't try to
pants you last year. You wave and smile, walking over. Dylan juts out
his chin.

"Hey," he says.

"Hey," you reply, matching his chin move.

You go for the low five, but you only make partial contact, and the
sound is disappointing.

"Wait, let's try again," you say.

"Nahhh, it is what it is."

Over the course of a year, Dylan became a fatalist.

You both just stand there, nodding, hands in pockets, looking out at the
crowd of other kids.

You get shoved from behind.

"Look who it is!" It was Matt Reichmann, his girlfriend Becky, and a
bunch of other older kids. "Hi there Stripper Manny. Can't wait to see
your show later. I heard it's all nude." The older kids are laughing.

Do youâ€¦
