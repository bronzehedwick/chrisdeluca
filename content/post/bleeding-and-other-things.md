Hello folks! So a more formal update is in order, I believe.

So I get a call from the hospital the other day and get the full fatty (my new word for skinny) on my health at the moment. As I mentioned in my last post, I passed my first benchmark with flying colors, but for those interested here&#8217;s the breakdown. When I was first diagnosed I had 90 something percent  mutated chromosomes out of however many were possible and however many they test at a time (I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t have more specific information in this regard, but I just don&#8217;t happen to know). As of the time of my test, I have 37%, which is excellent for this phase of the treatment.

However, as I also mentioned in my last post, my platelet count is still low, but not as low as I previously thought. Basically I bleed about as much as someone who takes aspirin everyday. I actually know this little factoid because I happened to be bleeding an amount which I felt was inordinate, but which my podiatrist convinced me otherwise per the above. Yes, it&#8217;s happened again: I&#8217;ve had an ingrown toe operated on once more. It&#8217;s not pleasant-sounding &#8211; in fact, if you&#8217;re not gagging already, I&#8217;ll have you know that it&#8217;s quite gross &#8211; so I won&#8217;t elaborate further.

Just kidding!  I had to leave directly from the podiatrists to go to work, reason being that the surgery was unexpected on my part&#8230;I suppose I could have told the doc to do it later, but forget that; I&#8217;m a man! Either that or an idiot&#8230;or are the terms synonymous? Damn man, I need to stop making jokes at me and my gender&#8217;s expense. Anyways, between driving, hobbling around and having low platelets, I bled right through the bandage, my sock, and even my shoe. I now have a noticeable red spot on my right shoe&#8217;s toe. I also have two giant bruises on my knee from rock climbing in the shlongunks&#8230;i mean shuangunks (gotta get that right) in New Paltz NY.

However, aside from the above blood related grossities, I&#8217;m doing great! Except now it&#8217;s 1:26am and I have to wake up tomorrow for work. Pssh! It&#8217;s all good&#8230;I&#8217;m an idiot! I mean a man.
