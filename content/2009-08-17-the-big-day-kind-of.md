Well folks, the big day has come and gone (please refer to my last post), and it turns out to have been a big anti-climax. First, I went to the podiatrist, and they DIDN&#8217;T operate on my toes, which I was expecting. For this I am very grateful, but NOT getting giant needles and construction grade wire-clippers stuck in and around your toes is far less dramatic than the opposite. Then, I go to the hospital to get my big cellular test&#8230;however three big things conspired to make this event less significant.

First, I was wrong, it was not a cellular test, but a genetic test, which actually makes sense. CML is caused by gene 9 and gene 22 getting messed up (no one knows why or how) and breaking apart, then fusing together to create a weird mutant gene that breeds cancer cells. So while I have no describable cancer cells in my blood, this test is checking to see how many CML genes there are, a.k.a the Philadelphia chromosome. At the onset of treatment, I had about 80% of my 9s and 22s fused into Philly chromes, and the bare minimum goal for one year of treatment is 30%&#8230;otherwise they&#8217;ll treat me differently. Not socially I imagine, but medically.

Second, I was wrong again; I haven&#8217;t been treated for six months; I&#8217;ve been treated for three. Whoopsie! An easy mistake. I don&#8217;t, like, keep track of time, or anything. Could be the fifth century B.C.E for all I know&#8230;if I even understood what &#8220;century&#8221; means.

Finally, the genetic testing takes two weeks to process, so major dud on dramatic information today. I did get my blood tested, and my whites are staying solid at 5.5, my reds are only slightly lower than normal, but my platelets are still very low. Oh well, I&#8217;ll have to be a bleeder for a little while longer. By the way, don&#8217;t you love how I waited until 300+ words into the post to get to the hard hitting facts? Made yall read that other nonsense!

In other news, I&#8217;ve been working on a new short cartoon. I won&#8217;t give anything away, but it&#8217;s called Embarrassing Moments For <span style="color:#339966;">Frogs</span>, and it should be done in a week or so.<figure id="attachment_57" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

The red circles are just an animation tool; they won&#8217;t show up in the finished product.

On another completely unrelated note (to cartoons or leukemia), I have been taking care of my aunt Stacie&#8217;s cat Seth for the past week. My aunt was supposed to come back Sunday, and I&#8217;ve been going over her place every night, because Seth is on his last legs, and if no ones there he gets lonely and pissed off and, well, cat-like. So I headed over there around eight o&#8217; clock this evening, unlock and open the door, and immediately smell smoke. Plus there&#8217;s a light on. Now, I figure my aunt came home early, which is often the case (my aunt smokes cigarettes for the record, and doesn&#8217;t set shit on fire to create the smoke, as some may have assumed). So I say hello, but no one answers. Wanting to make sure there wasn&#8217;t some random cig smoking, light turning on robber in the apartment, or worse yet, accidentally seeing my aunt naked, I stayed in the doorway and called her cell phone. It rang in the next room, and I asked if she was home. She said yes, so I knew she wasn&#8217;t lying&#8230;actually, I don&#8217;t know why I asked where she was, because obviously I knew, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. So anyway, I tell her I&#8217;m in the doorway, and she asks, &#8220;Which doorway?&#8221; I said, &#8220;The doorway to you&#8217;re apartment,&#8221; as if there was any good reason to call her if I was in any other doorway. (&#8220;Hello? Aunt Stacie? I&#8217;m in the doorway. Which doorway? The one to Pizza Hut. Bye.&#8221;) She says hold on and come out, fully clothed (thank God). She was just really tired and forgot to call me. But it makes for a damn good story, in my opinion! Love you aunt Stacie!

Alright, that about does it for me tonight. May you all have a happy and healthy whatever-day-you-read-this-on. Goodnight!
