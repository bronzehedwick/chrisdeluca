**Dancing at Lughnasa (1998)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120643/)

> The movie: Dancing at Lughnasa. Another Streep movie from the late 90's. We are Streep fans. Great acting by all the players. 5 spinster sisters living on the financal edge in 1930's Ireland. Poverty has marginalized the family's ability to operate and then industrialization shows up and makes matters worse. This is worth seeing but a good amount of heartache.
