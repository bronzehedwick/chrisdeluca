"Just frame it like, 'Let's see how much I can fail.'"

<!--more-->

I was sitting at a window table in a lower east side dive with a small group of
writers I had just met; Jon, Bettina, and Ashwin.

The bar was packed with an earnest, ex-party-hardy Saturday night crowd,
chatting in large, homogeneous groups or milling around the pool table. Wrapped
in an almost defensive southwestern theme—cowboy boots hanging from the
ceiling, pop country on the jukebox whenever the internet radio algorithm
felt inclined—the place seemed like it was straining to make sure you knew how
relaxed it was.

The lone software developer, I had been grilling each of the writers in turn
about freelance writing life. I have a creative writing degree, and while I
love my job writing code, I often dream about writing prose. Or, more
accurately, I dream about getting my prose published.

Dreams are one thing, but reality is another. While I yearned to be a part of
the literary world, the whole process of writing for publication terrified me.
Could I, a bald techie clutching a Guinness in a faux Honky-Tonk bar, in my
spare time, write freelance? I would need to be convinced, and it wouldn't be
easy. I wanted every scrap of knowledge. How do you stay motivated? How do you
chose your topics? How do you submit to publishers? In short, what is it like
to be a professional writer in 2019?

"It sucks," Ashwin said.

Hmm, so does working out, I thought, and I still manage to do that several
times a year. I was convinced: I was going to freelance write.

Garth Brook's bubble-gum twang swayed in the background. I felt inspired, ready
to take on this new challenge.  In that moment I decided my New Year's
resolution had not been ambitious enough, and I would change it to, "Get
Writing Published," instead of, "Get A Yogurt."

I told the group I was going to make 2019 the year I got my writing formally
published.

"Yeah, do it," Jon said.

Shit.

Things were looking down.

I wasn't good with rejection, if anyone is. It's one of the top reasons I
haven't submitted my writing more.

"Don't count the successes. Make it a game. A masochistic game," Bettina said.
"Just frame it like, 'Let's see how much I can fail.' Most people set a goal
like getting rejected 100 times."

Re-framing the problem, _and_ collect something? It was the perfect solution.
And that is _exactly_ what I'm going to do. Except 100 seems like a lot, so I'm
cutting it in half.

Talk about collecting comparisons: stamps, pokemon, some shit like that.

This time next year I hope to have **50 articles formally
rejected by reputable publications**.

I plan to post a round-up with all short descriptions of all the ill-fated
articles.

Until then, I'm going to grab a yogurt.
