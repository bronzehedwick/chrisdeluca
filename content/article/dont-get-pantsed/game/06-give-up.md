"What's the use? Dylan's right about life," You think as you crash
headlong into the only girl you'll ever love, knocking you both over.
Your fall is tragically broken by *her* body.

As you try to get up to help her, you step on your pant leg and you
stand up out of your pants. You find out that the love of your life's
name is Mia, but only because the medics keep asking her that to keep
her awake.

Your life is over. :skull:
