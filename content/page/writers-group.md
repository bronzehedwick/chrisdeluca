+++

The process for the writer's group I run.

* You can either write a piece to be work shopped, or come to only provide a critique.
* If you brought a story you can and should critique others.
* Stories can be any form or genre (e.g. prose, poetry, comics, etc), but should be no longer than 10 pages. They can be part of a larger work, as long as it sticks to the page count.
* If you bring a story, please email it to me before Sunday May 7th.
* Story file format can be in any common file type, with a bias towards plain text, because it's the god damn best.
* I will send stories to the group prior to the meeting.
* Please read stories ahead of time, take notes, and be prepared to give thoughtful, constructive feedback to the author. Often, smaller comments are written on the lines they pertain to, while broader feedback is provided in prose at the end.
* At the meeting, we will read the stories out loud, then have a discussion to provide feedback.
* Notes and written feedback is given to the author after the conversation, either digitally, or printed.
