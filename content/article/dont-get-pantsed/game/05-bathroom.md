You take your bag into the bathroom. Almost instantly, the boys figure
out what you're doing, and start jeering.

"Oooh, new kid is shyyyy," wails Josh, in the sing-song tone reserved
only for the most devastating taunts.

You shut the bathroom door quickly and change as fast as you can.
Your ears burn hot. By the time you force yourself to come out of the
bathroom, everyone seems to have moved on, and no one cares.

They all file out onto the field. You're confused and humiliated. Your
pants are on.

Success! :100:

A few days later you have a free block, and decide to take the nature
hike. You remember from last year that the hike was mostly full of
neo-hippies and kids who didn't know what else to do. Perfect.

You walk out to the starting spot in the meadow near the trees. You see
a few groups of kids milling around. You walk towards the cluster who
seems most likely to know what hemp is. You talk to a lanky white kid
with blond dreads.

"Hey, is this the group for the nature hike?" You ask.

"Sure thing, brother. You've come to the right place." He laughs from
the chest, like something really funny happened. Did you miss something?

"Cool. I'm Manny, by the way." You extend your hand.

The guy grasps your hand weakly, as if he didn't want to hurt the
microbes on your palms. It feels like holding a dish rag.

"What's your name?" You ask.

"Sun Child."

"Oh. Cool."

"Werd, werd, werd."

His grin stays fixed in place. You're now convinced he's completely
genuine, and that doesn't comfort you. You both nod and wait for the
hike to start.
