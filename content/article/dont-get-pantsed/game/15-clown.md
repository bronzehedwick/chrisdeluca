You're best and only hope to get out of this alive (socially), is to make
a joke out of the situation.

You stick out your tongue and gyrate sarcastically.

"They call me Magic Manny. I'm like Magic Mike, but Mannier," you say.

No one laughs. You drop your drawers. The fabric hitting the floor is
audible. Silence.

"That was fuckin' weird, bro," says Yani.

"His dance or his dick?" screams Adalfo, going for the high-five. Now
everyone laughs.

You're pants are gone. Your life is over. :skull:
