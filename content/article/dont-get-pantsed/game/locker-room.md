You try out for the baseball team, and while your picked second to last,
you still make the cut. You're in.

The next day, you're in the locker room with all these big kids who had
not only fully hit puberty, but hit back. Most are horsing around. Josh,
a tall kid with a dirt lip snaps a towel at a howling lump of muscle
passing for a kid. They called him "Crunch."

Another kid motions you over, the half-way sensitive Phillipe.

"Your locker's over there, new kid," he says, pointing to a corner.

"My name's Manny," you say.

"No yet it isn't, new kid." Phillipe pretends to drop a mic, makes
an explosion sound, and backs away. He cuts himself off with a grin,
slumping casually.

"I'm just playing, Manny. Come on, get changed. Just a joke."

You'll have to get used to jock "jokes" again.

The locker room roils with untethered masculinity. You hold your bag.
