<!-- This intro should be a lot tighter, and more evocative of the specific life Manny leads -->

You are Manny Alvarez. It's the first week of summer camp. You like
playing baseball, playing music, and not getting pantsed.

You grew up in Washington Heights, your parents are both CPAs, and
Carlos Santana's _Supernatural_ album was a major event for your family
life. Even _Shaman_ was pretty big.

You don't know anyone here. Three weeks of potential, countless
opportunities for disaster. You cannot be pantsed here. You were pantsed
twice last year.

The first time was at a house party you managed to squirm your way into.
You were somehow talking to Sydney Tan, and Eric Garcetti pantsed you
from behind. Everyone laughed, even Sydney, although she tried to hide
it. Now everyone's seen your scared penis. You hope Eric chokes to death
on throat cancer.

The other time you got pantsed was during class a month later. You kept
getting the problem on the board wrong, and sister Agnes tried to stamp
on your foot to help God make you better at math, but instead she caught
your pant leg, you tripped, and your sweat pants got yanked down, baring
your ass to the class.

Eric Garcetti laughed so hard he cried, and sister Agnes found it so
amusing she almost stopped frowning. You hoped they'd both just die.
Instead, sister Agnes got a promotion, and Eric got laid a lot.

But here at camp, it's different. Or, it could be. You have a real
opportunity to be someone else here. Or at least get a better nickname
than "Stripper Manny". You just can't get pantsed. If you get pantsed
again, your life is over. Don't get pantsed. You're thirteen.

<!-- There should be a part here that is a specific awkward, could go either way, weird moment with some kids. -->

You're all moved into your cabin, and your youngest sister makes faces
at you from the back seat of your mom's battered station wagon as it
pulls away. You mill around on the outskirts of the camp's central
meadow, watching all the camp kids reuniting with their camp friends.

Pretty soon, a general assembly is called, and a couple hundred kids
congregate in the great hall.

<!-- Name the camp -->

"We have a lot of great activities planned this summer. Anyone can dip
in and out of whatever daily activities strike their fancy, but if
you want to be in the talent show or the sports competitions with our
friendly rivals Camp Smokey Claw (boo!), you need to try out now and set
aside most of your daily time to those activities."

You're only decent at two things: second base, and bass guitar. Trying
out for either would give you a whole set of friends and open up a world
of possibilities. But you have to choose.

---

You arrive at camp, awash in gaggles of kids reuniting. You had been
to camp last year and had made a few friends, so you were pretty sure
there would be some one you knew here. Most of the kids who went to the
camp had been every year since they were nine, so cliques were firmly
established. Last year you had generally made friends ith the kids who
no one else wanted to be friends with. The outcasts. The weenies.

You need to get a better nickname. Last year, Matt Richman pantsed you
twice, and would have pantsed you a third time except you wore your
pants belted near your nipples, which mad you look like a wuss *and* and
jackass. Both successful pantsing Matt and older kids had come running
up behind you while you were walking from your cabin and yanked down
your pants as he blew past, hooting loud enough for the whole camp to
turn and look and laugh.

The second time Matt had gotten your underwear.

Matt had a reputation as an asshole, and he had age out of camp last
year. He was probably in juvie by now, you thought. That, or Yale.

You had a reputation for getting pantsed last year, so if it happened
again you'd just get pantsed forever. That reputation would stick, just
like it stuck to Ronnie Winkletrout. Ronnie was a doughy camp regular
who had been pantsed so much by Matt Richman that *other* kids started
pantsing him too. They called him, "Stripper Ronnie."

He hasn't been back since.

You can't let that happen to you. You can't get pantsed.

You spot Dylan Brown, an alright kid who didn't try to pants you last
year. You wave and smile, walking over. Dylan juts out his chin.

"Hey."

"Hey."

You go for the low five, but you only make partial contact, and the
sound is disappointing.

"Wait, let's try again," you say.

"Nahhh, it is what it is."

Huh, over the course of a year, Dylan became a fatalist.

You both just stand there, nodding, hands in pockets, looking out at the
crowd of other kids. You get shoved from behind.

"Look who it is!" It was Matt Richman, his girlfriend Becky, and a
bunch of other older kids. "Look who has graced us with his presence
but Stripper Manny. Can't wait to see your show later. I heard it's all
nude." The older kids were laughing.

Anger boiled up. "You're not pantsing me again, dickhead!" The older
boys laughed and hooted.

"Who said anything about pantsing? *You're* the one who strips!" More
laughter.

Becky pushed Matt. "Oh my God, you're so immature."

Matt fained hurt. "Me? Immature? How dare you?" He let out a low belch.

"Ugh, you're disgusting," Becky yelled, pushing him away. But she was
laughing. Everyone was laughing. They moved on.

"I'm not getting pantsed," you say, more to yourself than anything.

"Nahhh, you're getting pantsed," said Dylan. Great, more fatalism. It's
going to be a long summer.
