You throw yourself off the path, and tumble into a thorn bush. You're
covered in scratches and bruises, and you wail pathetically as Sun Child
helps you get untangled from the thorns. Many people are concerned for
your well-being, but many more think you're an immature jackass for
racing up a mountain and spacing out about cat stance.

You find out your love's name is Mia, and that she is very firmly in the
latter group.

You heart breaks every time she rolls her eyes.

Your pants are still on.

Success! :100:

It's an hour after lights out, and you're trying to fall asleep, but the
damage you sustained on the trail is making it difficult. You hear a
whisper from the bottom bunk.

"Psst, key kid." It sounds like Markus still doesn't know your name.

"What?" You ask, acting groggy; if he's going to start talking about his
B.M.I. again you want to be able to fain falling asleep.

"We're sneaking out to the girl's cabin to play strip poker. You in?"

*Strip* poker? You're terrified.

Are youâ€¦
