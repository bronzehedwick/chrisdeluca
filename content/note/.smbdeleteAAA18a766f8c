**The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052905/)

> I'm watching the _Hound of the Baskervilles_. Christopher Lee stars. From 1959 in color. The color is richer than that of today. Lee is tall and debonnaire. Hopfully he has acting abilty. I remember he was also in a Star Wars movie.

> Ah yes. Holmes is played by Peter Cushing. Quick witted. Powerful deductive reasoning, small and agile. Also compassionate. Good color but definately low budget. filmed in the English countryside where it happened. And yes the Hound is a stuff animal.
