**The Apartment (1960)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053604/)

> The movie: The Apartment. OK another oldie but one definately worth viewing. This show stars Fred MacMurray, Shirley Maclane and Jack Lemon. Although it is somewhat dated. It presents atitudes and mores toward infidelity prevelant during the 1950's.
>
> MacMurray is fasinating as an executive cheating on his wife.When he starred in Double Indemnity a few years earlier, he actually murdered his girlfriend's husband for insurance money. Now he only cheats on his wife.
> 
> His evolution: A few years later he is a very loving family patriach on the TV hit series My Three Sons. Shirley is young and impressive as the girlfriend. Jack plays his best, neurotic self .
> The subject of infidelity and callousness towards women and employees is well handled in this film.
> —John DeLuca
