"You're not pantsing me again, dick head!" You yell. The older
boys laugh and hoot.

"Who said anything about pantsing? *You're* the one who strips!" More
laughter.

Becky pushes Matt. "Oh my God, you're so immature."

Matt fains hurt. "Me? Immature? How dare you?" He lets out a low belch.

"Ugh, you're disgusting," Becky yells, pushing him again. But she's
laughing. Everyone is laughing. They moved on.

"I'm not getting pantsed," you mutter, angry.

"Nahhh, you're getting pantsed," Dylan yawns. More fatalism.

Success! :100:

You sign up for baseball, and while you're picked second to last,
you still make the cut. You're in.

The camp isn't big enough to separate by age too much, so you're in the
locker room with all these big kids who had not only fully hit puberty,
but hit back. Most are horsing around. Josh, a tall kid with a dirt lip
snaps a towel at a howling lump of muscle passing for a kid. They called
him "Crunch."

Another kid motions you over, the half-way sensitive Phillipe.

"Your locker's over there, new kid," he says, pointing to a corner.

"My name's Manny," you say.

"Not yet it isn't, new kid." Phillipe pretends to drop a mic, makes
an explosion sound, and backs away. He cuts himself off with a grin,
slumping casually.

"I'm just playing, Manny. Come on, get changed. Just a joke."

You'll have to get used to jock "jokes" again.

The locker room roils with untethered masculinity. You hold your bag.

Do youâ€¦
