This book sucked. What a turd. Prose that somehow made me care less about the characters, and characters that made me care less about books. A plot with all the tension of spaghetti. Twists that you would need to surround that word in so many quotes as to be unrecognizable.

A dumb book with bad everything. I read all of it.
