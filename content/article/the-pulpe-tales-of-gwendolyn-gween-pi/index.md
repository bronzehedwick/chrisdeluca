Folks, it is my distinct pleasure, honor, and plonor[^1] to announce the
release of *[The Pulp Tales of Gwendolyn Gween, P.I.][gwen]*, a scripted serial
comedy podcast I wrote and created with my partner Daniel Contreras. In fact,
not only is the show released, all six episodes in this season are out right
now, so you can binge the whole thing.

However convincing the above has been in getting you to blindly subscribe to
something on the internet, you may still have some questions.

## What Is This Crap?

Rude, but I'll allow it.

*[The Pulp Tales of Gwendolyn Gween, P.I.][gwen]* is a **scripted** comedy
podcast. That means it's *not* people talking about their re-watch of some
90's sitcom, or discussions about something educational. While those are all
awesome shows, *[The Pulp Tales of Gwendolyn Gween, P.I.][gwen]* is carefully
written, and performed by talented actors, like a TV show, but for your ears.

{{< figure src="images/vicky.svg" alt="Vicky Vance looking like she's contemplating something hard" class="align-right" width="200" caption="Vicky Vance, Gwen's rich main bitch" >}}

The show is a pastiche of film noir set in New York City, and follows a junior
detective, Gwen Gween, as she cracks cases and searches for her lost parents
amidst a world gone mad. If that doesn't sound exciting, then check your
adrenal glands. If that doesn't sound funny, then just listen for a few minutes
and we'll hopefully prove your doubting ass wrong.

This is a serialized show, so you need to listen to each episode in succession
to understand the plot. That may sound like a lot more work, but you already do
it for every HBO show and it really just means there's jokes that reference
other jokes.

## Why Should I Care?
Because if you're reading this, chances are, this show is for you.
