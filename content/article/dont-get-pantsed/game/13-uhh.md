"Uhh…" you say, feeling trapped, not knowing what else to say. Alex laughs.

"He don't know what ta do!"

Now everyone's laughing. Becky rolls her eyes, shakes her head.

"So corny," she intones.

You've outed yourself as a clueless neophyte who can't speak properly
when called upon. Your pants are still on. Success! :100:

The game continues, and you are exceptionally not good. The others, who
all seem to know each other, are able to weave play into effortless
flirting opportunities, while still avoiding the full Monty.

You, on the other hand, unceremoniously lose cloths at an alarming rate.

Even though you started out with more clothing, somehow you're down to
your tighty whities.

You lose the hand.

There's a collective cringe. It's clear from how everyone shifts
uncomfortably that no one wanted you to be the first person to get fully
nude. You would be insulted, but you're too busy agreeing with them.

"Alright, man," says Kimberly, "you're up."

The stage is yours.

Do you…
