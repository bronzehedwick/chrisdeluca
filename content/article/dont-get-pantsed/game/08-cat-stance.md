"Think like a cat! Think like a cat!" You think, like a human.

You have no idea what cat stance is, but you know if you're going to
have a prayer of pulling this off, you'll need to fully commit.

You bend your knees and squat, arching your back. Your pants hook on
a sharp rock, you spin as you fall, ripping your pants in half at the
crotch.

You crash onto your back, sliding with a dirt avalanche right to your
love's feet. Your pant rip provides a bulbous view of half a testicle.

You're finally thinking like a cat; you hiss and paw the air.

Your life is over. :skull:
