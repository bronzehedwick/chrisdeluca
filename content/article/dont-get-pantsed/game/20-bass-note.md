You are cornered: in every direction there's opportunities to make
everything even worse. Your only way out is to acknowledge the
situation.

You play a long, slide bass note, like someone just made a dirty joke on
a talk show.

The world seems to hold still, frozen in state. Then, the entire room
bursts out laughing.

You look around, beyond humiliated. Then, you hear a few shouts of,
"Hell yeah, Manny!" and "Take the power back!"

It's not everyone, and you're not sure how long it will last, but at
least some of the people in the crowd are laughing _with_ you. You'll
take it.

Plus, Matt Reichmann is unconscious.

You win! :100: :guitar:
