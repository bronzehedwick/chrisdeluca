"Think like a cat! Think like a cat!" You think, frantically.

You have no idea what cat stance is, but you know if you're going to
have a prayer of pulling this off, you'll need to fully commit.

You bend your knees and squat, arching your back. Your pants hook on
a sharp rock, you spin as you fall, ripping your pants in half at the
crotch.

You crash onto your back, sliding with a dirt avalanche right to your
love's feet. Your pant rip provides an unflattering view of half your
left testicle.

Your body is well behind your brain, and you hiss and paw the air, like
a cat.

Your life is over. :skull:
