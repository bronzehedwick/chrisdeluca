**The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/)

> The movie: The Hobbit.Of course this is a great movie to see whether or not you read the book. If     you haven't read the book, read it you'll enjoy the movie even more so. But here's the point. People get up in the morning and feel bad about themselves. They reflect on all their problems and want to take pills to deal with them or they  overeat. The next time that happens, think of Bilbo Baggins and what he had to face each and every day of his adventure with no background to do that job. Makes our problems seem small. I also recall that Tolkien served in WWI. He probably came from a genteel background with little understanding of the world of war.Our job seems easy in comparasion.
