Well hello again folks!

Once again I have been a bad blogger and neglected this one for quite some time, so consider this post both my apology and my attempt at rectification. There have been several recent health developments worth mentioning.

<!--more-->

First of all, my internal organs are looking good, my liver being the one exception, which is still looking a hell of a lot better than it did before, just a tad under a normal person&#8217;s (if that normal person hadn&#8217;t been drinking heavily for the past 10 years, which is a significant improvement for me!). 

Since my numbers were looking so sexy (much like a super model with a slight limp), the doctors have cut my prednisone from 20 mg every other day to 10 mg every other day. The less steroids the better, is my motto, so I&#8217;m very excited to have this fulfilled in reality. In another few weeks I&#8217;ll be up for review again (kind of like getting your PhD, but with less papers and more tests) and if I&#8217;m still doing good they will either cut my prednisone down to 5 mg every other day, or eliminate it entirely.

In addition, my photophresis schedule has been cut down as well, going from twice every week to twice every two weeks. This has been my first week without photo, or any trip to the clinic for that matter, since May. Once I&#8217;m completely off the prednisone, and still doing well, they can start taking down my photo even more to twice every three weeks, to twice a month, and finally to graduation (diploma not included). 

Then, once I&#8217;m off photo, and still doing well, they can start taking me off prograf, the immuno suppressant, and once I start coming off that I also start to come off every other pill I take, as they are all countering drugs for the side effects of prograf (read: not having an immune system). So I&#8217;m looking forward to that. Otherwise I feel good, and I have lots of energy. Stairs still kick my ass, leaving me panting like a dog in heat or a transplant patient who just climbed stairs, but it&#8217;s getting better.

In other news, I finished day one of [NaNoWriMo][2], or **Na**tional **No**vel **Wri**ting **Mo**nth. In this month, participants try to write a full novel (at least 50,000 words) in the month of November (for those of you who don&#8217;t remember their nursery songs, that&#8217;s 30 days). I have successfully written at least 1,664 words today, as per my goal (50,000 / 30). Check the newly added NaNoWriMo widget in the sidebar for updates, or you can visit my profile [here][3].
