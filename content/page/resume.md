## Objective

Senior front end engineer with over 8 years experience, looking for work with a high social impact and interesting technology.

## Experience

### Senior front end developer, _Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center_; 2015–Present

I was a key technical and UX resource for transitioning the brand to using a design system, using Pattern Lab and Knapsack.

I managed technical interns from Code Nation, as well as third-party front end developers.

I was the primary technical resource for all front end development on the mskcc.org property, implementing complex projects precisely and quickly.

I focused on accessibility, enhancing the site for screen readers and for other disabilities, to ADA AA level compliance.

### Front end developer, _The Daily Beast_; 2015

I helped migrate a Backbone code base from CQ5 to a modern Node Express app, as well as starting a migration from dust templating to React.

I wrote a full integration and functional test suite, and built a gulp build pipeline that included code linting.

I also transitioned front end code to ES6, and performed a performance audit and improvement.

### Front end developer, _Institute for Integrative Nutrition_; 2014–2015

I lead the front end team in the architecture and implementation of a fully responsive re- design, using modular LESS and Drupal panels.

I was also in charge of documenting all the new features for both developers and editors, and for editor training.

In addition, I created several devops tools, including a gulp script that automatically minified images on an Amazon S3 bucket, and another that performed PHP and JavaScript code linting on every pull request, all using Jenkins.

### Drupal developer, _Spanfeller Media Group_; 2013–2014

I took over integrating a massive wine database, importing over 10k listings from WineHQ into Drupal, with cross-referenced custom content from editors.

I significantly improved performance on the site through caching, SQL query optimizations, and PHP improvements found through NewRelic.

I also managed junior developers, maintained a legacy and bespoke Drupal 6 code base, and prepared for a full Drupal 7 migration, interfacing directly with the transition team.

### Front end developer, _Logicworks_; Contract—2013

I was the lead front end developer on the http://logicworks.net upgrade from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7. The task was to upgrade the back end without changing the front end design, yet making it responsive. Since the original site had not been designed with responsive in mind, it was an interesting challenge to make it all work.

Since there were no additional mobile designs created, the task fell to me to create a mo- bile and tablet experience that matched the look and feel of the desktop version, while still accommodating smaller screens.

Used Sass and the Zen base theme.

### Front end developer, _American Media Inc_; 2012–2013

I maintained 12 distinct Drupal code bases, one for each magazine, and re-created the Star Magazine site using Wordpress.

I was also a key developer in a redesign of the Shape website, and created a one-off PHP project for a Zumba sign up (also for Shape).

A notable Drupal module I built was one that only let a regular user role add a taxonomy term to a node if that term already existed (it would have had to have been added by a higher privileged role first).

### Technical Artist, _Playmatics Inc_; 2011–2012

I worked on The Untouchables Adobe Air iOS game, working primarily on the in-app purchase store. The game is still in the App Store.

I created the company website using Drupal, and was in charge of managing several client relationships.

I also coded several game prototypes in Flash/Actionscript 3, and did iterative CSS styling for the Disney Kingdom Keepers web game, and for PBS's History Detectives game.
