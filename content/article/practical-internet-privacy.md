Welcome, Internet folks! If you've been following along, this is the final post
in my [three]({{< relref "article/security-vs-privacy-on-the-internet.md" >}})
[part]({{< relref "article/practical-internet-security.md" >}}) series on basic
Internet security and privacy. In this article, we're going to get into improving
and---just as importantly---*understanding* Internet privacy.

A word of warning: as the third and final chapter of this series, it is also the
longest and least focused. This "cram-it-all-in-part-three" approach will be
familiar to anyone who watched *The Lord of the Rings: The Return Of the King*.
While this article is similar to that movie in almost every respect, I will *try*
to keep false-endings and ghost armies to a minimum.

## Why the stakes are higher in a Trump administration

* Obama was no saint when it comes to security
* Trump's pick for internet is real anti-free internet

### 3. Tape your camera

If you haven't heard of this, it must sound strange. But yes, tape your laptop
and phone camera, and open Skype or Photo Booth to make sure you can't see
anything through the lens. Why?

It's easier to attack your camera than it is to get into the rest of your
computer, and it's a popular method of information gathering. If an attacker got
in, it would be very hard to detect, since they could keep the camera light off,
even while recording.

But what could an attacker do with video from your camera, other than blackmail
you with footage of you whacking off? You can't be sure until it happens, but
there's usually lots of identifying information about you that an attacker could
use, and they can just wait until the piece they need comes in view.

Before you get too scared, this type of attack would have be targeted at you
specifically, so it is much less likely to happen. However, the fallout from
such an attack is enormous, and the solve is so cheap and easy, it's really a no
brainier. If [Mark Zuckerberg][mark-tapes] and the [FBI director][fbi-tapes]
both do it, you might as well, too.
