You take your bag into the bathroom. Almost instantly, the boys figure
out what you're doing, and start jeering.

"Oooh, new kid is shyyyy," wails Josh, in the sing-song tone reserved
only for the most devastating taunts.

You shut the bathroom door quickly and change as fast as you can. You
are completely humiliated. Your ears burn hot. By the time you force
yourself to come out of the bathroom, everyone seems to have moved on,
and no one cares.

They all file out onto the field. You're confused and humiliated, but at
least you weren't pantsed.

Success!
