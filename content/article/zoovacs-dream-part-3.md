You are Balzac Globotron, an alien in space. You are looking for the Trance Gem, a crystal of incredible power. You beam onto the bridge of a derelict space ship, and notice movement beyond the rusted control panels. "We're being hailed," you say into your comlink. "I'm Balzac Globotron." The voice is familiar, but not unpleasant: it's that of a human female, with a British accent.

**> “Hello Bethany, so nice of you to drop by. “**

"Bethany?" you reply. "What do you want? I don't think we have any business here." She smiles at you, and then points out a panel on the wall behind her.

**> “No, you wouldn’t....you wouldn’t push that button....would you?”**

"Oh no! No, no, no!" she says. "It's just me, my husband and our son. We were going to visit some friends back home."

**> “Oh, thank God. Don’t scare me like that, Bethany. Is this derelict space ship your home, or are you just on your way there?”**

**> “Okay, well do you know anything about where the Trance Gem might be?”**

"Well, yes, actually. It's deep within the bowels of this vessel. The captain has been keeping it hidden from all others since he was first commissioned as a starship commander."

**> “That rat! Very well, I will journey to the depths of this vessel and retrieve the gem. Many thanks for your assistance, Bethany. “**

You beam down to the lower levels of the ship, which look more like a prison than a place of exploration. There are several large metal doors leading off to various parts of the ship, but none open up to a room containing the gem.

**> Scan the air ducts for energy signals.**

You find nothing, so you begin scanning the air ducts for energy signatures. You feel around, trying to sense if there is something buried under the floor or above you somewhere. Nothing comes through.

**> Hypnotize myself into a trace to sense where the Trance Gem is.**

You turn yourself into a trace, and send out a signal to try to sense where the gem might be. You can only detect energy readings near the surface of the ship, but you are confident that you have found its location. "Good job, Balzac," says Bethany.

**> “Thanks Bethany” I say, and move to the location of the gem.**

You move to the spot where you sensed the energy signature, and begin searching for it again. This time, however, you find nothing. You continue searching until you reach another door at the end of a corridor. "There must be another way out of here,"

**> “Wait, I’m SURE the trance gem was here. Bethany, did you steal the Trance Gem?”**

"I didn't steal it. I was just following orders when I sent out the signal." "Then why isn't there a trace coming from anywhere else on this ship?" "The tracker system is offline. The ship itself is still working fine, though."

**> “Ghhha! Then who took the Gem? Where is it?”**

"It's in the cargo hold, along with other valuable items. I don't think anyone would want it, though." "What does it mean if someone doesn't want it?" Bethany smiles.

**> “Too coy, Bethany, too coy,” I say as I move to the cargo deck.**

You move to the cargo deck, and search for the gem. Again, you find no trace of it. "Maybe I should get rid of it now." "No, not yet. We need to keep it safe until we can track down whoever stole it.

**> Scan for other life signs on the ship.**

You move to the upper decks, and scan for any life forms. You find nothing, so you return to the area where you felt the energy signature. "Hmm... what a strange sensation..." I say as I move back towards my previous position.

**> The sensation feel like electricity moving up and down my orbs. It must be a clue.**

You move back towards your original position, and feel a sudden tingling sensation. You move your hands over them, feeling they are glowing slightly red hot. "That's a good one!" I say as I take my hands away. "Now I know where the gem is."

**> “Excellent!” I say and move to the location of the gem.**

You move to the location of the gem, and begin looking around for traces of it. You find none, so you head back to Bethany. "Where is it?" she asks. "In the cargo hold." "How do I open that thing?" she asks.

**> “Press the button behind you, Bethany. Don’t argue! It’s our only hope of ever getting that Gem now.”**

She presses the button behind her, and opens the hatch. Inside, you see a large metal box. The lid closes shut, sealing off the cargo bay. "Well done," I say as I step inside myself. "We're all set to go."

**> I open the lid, finding the gem inside.**

You press the lid open, and find yourself staring into a bright light. A beam of pure white light shoots out from within the box, hitting you directly in the chest. Your body goes limp instantly, and you fall backwards onto the floor.

**> I feel Mystikal power surge through me. I wake up hours later from my trance, in a Forrest.**

Your eyes snap open, and you look around at the room. You find yourself lying on a bed, surrounded by green grass and trees. There is also a small table with several bottles of liquid sitting next to each other.

**> Read the labels on the bottles.**

You turn your head, and notice a bottle labeled 'Water' next to another labelled 'Food'. You pick up the water bottle, and drink some of it.

**> Discover my coordinates**

You sit up, and check your surroundings. You see a window, which shows a view of the outside world. You also notice that you are standing on an island, with a few buildings nearby.

**> Walk to the buildings.**

You stand up, and walk to the nearest building. As you approach, you realize that there is no one here. You walk further in, and finally find a door with a lock. Opening it reveals a small hallway leading away from the main part of the ship.

**> Walk to the end of the hallway.**

You walk down the hallway, and eventually reach a dead end. You decide not to explore this area any further.

**> Go back to the bed and drink the bottle of food.**

You return to the bed, and start drinking the bottle of food. After a while, you begin feeling slightly hungry again. You continue eating until you have finished it off completely. Afterwards, you lie down on the bed once more, and wait for Mystikal to take over.

**> Let Mystikal take over, bringing me back to the derelict ship and Bethany.**

You lie down on the bed once more, and wait for Mystikal to take over. The next day comes quickly enough, as you awake to find Mystikal standing before you.

**> Let Mystikal take over, bringing me back to the derelict ship and Bethany with a jolt.**

You lay down on the bed once more, and wait for Mystikal to take over. The next day comes quickly enough, as you awaken to find Mystikal standing before you.

**> “Mystikal, you must be the power hidden in the trance gem, personified. “**

You lay down on the bed once more, and wait for Mystikal to take over. The next day comes quickly enough, as you wake up to find Mystikal standing before you.

**> “Mystikal - you must be the power of the trance gem personified. “**

You lay down on the bed once more, and wait for Mystikal to take over. The next day comes quickly enough, as you wake up to find Mystikal standing before you. Your mind begins to wander into strange places...

**> Wander off, fully enveloped in the trace, lost for all eternity.**

You lay down on the bed once more, and wait for Mystikal to take over. The next day comes quickly enough, as you wake up to find Mystikal standing before you. You think about what just happened.
