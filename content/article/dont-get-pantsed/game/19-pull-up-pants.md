You know the audience about to burst into derisive laughter. Your
only hope to stem the tide is to get your pants back up as quickly as
possible.

You bend down and grab your jeans. Behind you, Gina, the drummer, makes
a scared noise, rasping something about your butt hole.

You yank your pants up, but move too fast, jamming the waistband into
your junk.

It makes your balls look like cartoon eyes bugging out.

The room explodes in laughter.

Your life is over. :skull:
