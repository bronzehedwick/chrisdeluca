{{< figure src="/images/titicut.jpg" alt="Still-frame from Titicut Follies showing an inmate arguing with his doctor." >}}

I recently saw *Titicut Follies*, the 1969 documentary film about the harrowing
conditions in a Massachusetts prison for the criminally insane. The movie was
banned by the state of Massachusetts until it was deemed unconstitutional
in the late 80s.

One of the subjects is a man who has been transferred from a regular prison to
this mental facility. He is very clearly sane, and argues logically in his own
defense. His explanations are never taken seriously.

At a hearing of some kind, after the man has once again logically laid out that
he is not crazy, the officials talk amongst themselves.

"It's classic paranoid delusions," says a nurse, "If you accept his basic
premise, everything else he says is quite logical. Of course, his basic premise
is incorrect."

All I could keep thinking was that context largely shapes perception; the man
was in the nut house, hence he must be nuts.

Hauntingly, he kept repeating, "You're harming me."

That got me thinking about how many other times we completely reject each
other's reality because we "reject their basic premise." I'm not arguing for
subjective reality, but I think a lot of what is happening politically is the
result of ignoring basic premises. We don't have different points of view, in
America; we have different planets.
