Well hello folks, just a short post this time.

It&#8217;s happened. I feel practically myself again. I&#8217;m free from pain, my energy is up, and my mind is limber. The only things different<!--more--> is that I don&#8217;t have quite as much energy as I used to, but since I barely do anything physical anyway, I hardly notice. Although that reminds me, I should start exorcising. My muscles have atrophied far enough, and my stick-like figure freak a lot of people out. Also, my hugs occasionally cause puncture wounds. Although, come to think of it, I&#8217;ve always been skinny, and so has my dad, and so has my granddad, so maybe that&#8217;s just me&#8230;but they have muscles and things, and aren&#8217;t so bony. Alright, point is, I should exorcise, but now I&#8217;ve completely lost my point.

My point is, that I feel practically myself, and that I can return to work. This is nice, because my savings will only pay college loans for so long. It&#8217;s also nice because I feel like I&#8217;m pulling my weight again&#8230;although I&#8217;m not working yet, so I should save that feeling for later. The bad news is I&#8217;ll have to go back to Bergen for now. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a great little part time job, but right after the Fall semester ended, I was really ready to move on, and it feels kind of lame to go back. Well, life intercedes, as they say. I really can&#8217;t commit to beating the road looking for jobs right now, Leukemia-based circumstances dictate I take it slower, so the Bergen gig will be good until I find something better. That is a really great thing about my Leukemia experience; I&#8217;ve slowed down a lot and really appreciated what I have and what happens day to day. I really feel like I&#8217;m _living_, instead of just passing through.

At any rate, I&#8217;ll send an email to Bergen tomorrow and see if I can still get my old job back. I&#8217;ll keep yall posted! Peace.
