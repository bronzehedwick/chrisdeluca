While the prose is energetic and engaging, I kept finding myself not giving a shit about what happens next.

A lot of boomer fantasies about the young kids worshiping the same music they did, and in the same way.

Plus, the groan-o-clock trope of women inexplicably throwing themselves at the tough-guy author stand-in protagonist.

Contains the back cover quote gem, "segue from real life to reel life."

There's cringe-y passages that attempt to show off racial awareness while also sound hip, like how the kids talk, which ends up sounding like if a robot's personality was programmed only with after school specials and Steven Seagal movies.

Alternate title: "Grandpa Farted A Crime Caper"

But, it kept me reading to the end, so I can't complain. The prose moves, man.
