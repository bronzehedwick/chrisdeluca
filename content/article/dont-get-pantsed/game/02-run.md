You set your jaw and stare Matt straight in the glazed eye, then
turn and run as fast as you can.

"You chicken shit!" Matt yells after you. You have a moment of panic as
you hear him following you, before *WHAM*! Matt tackles you and rips
your pants down.

"Don't run, you're a stripper." He drums an unearned "ba-doom-pish"
rim shot on your ass, then wanders away with his friends.

Every kid around you is crying laughing.

Your life is over. :skull:
