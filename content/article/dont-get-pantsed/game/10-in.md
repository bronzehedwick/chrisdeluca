"Uhh, yeah, yeah, sounds…sounds cool."

You throw on your clothes, and add a sweater and jacket even though it's
not at all cold. Half the boys in your cabin creep outside with you,
hunching over, a few holding pretend pistols and humming theme music as
they sneak.

It's you, Markus, Alex Yani, Adalfo Gonzalez, and Phillipe from baseball.

"Hey, where were you yesterday? You off the team?" He asks.

"Uhh, yeah, I'm just…yeah. Whatever, you know?"

"Yeah, alright, whatever."

You creep through the darkness and arrive with the rest of the crew at
the girl's cabin. You go around back, and Markus knocks on the window.
Jess Buono opens it, stubbing her finger in the jam.

"Shit," she says, shaking her hand, her hoop bracelets jangling.

"Yo, quiet, your RA is gonna hear," Markus hisses.

"Oh, grow up, Janet takes an Ambien every night. Why do you think we're
having it here?" She sucks her bruised finger. "Come in."

You all climb in the window and drop into the cleanest room you've ever
been in. There's candles lit around in a circle.

"Where'd you get the candles?" Asks Adalfo.

"A lady never tells," says Kimberly Tan, smirking and raising an eyebrow.

"Girl, you trippin'," laughs Adalfo.

You're terrified, trying hard not to visibly tremble. All these kids
are so cool they have their own secret language. Plus they seem super
comfortable about this ritualized nudity. Wasn't showing your junk the
worst thing that could happen to you?

You don't know the rules anymore, but feel like they're something you're
missing. You hope to God you're not one of those people who get fear
boners. As soon as you think that thought, you get a little hard. You
sit down, quickly, right where you're standing.

"Alright, everyone sit in a circle behind the candles, so it's boy girl
boy girl," says Shaunte Williams. She points at you. "Hey, circle's over
here."

You're sitting by the window, across the room from the circle. Great,
already you look like a jackass.

"Sorry," you say, getting up awkwardly to hide your half-chub. You
crab walk over to the circle, noticing on the way over a pile of dirty
clothes shoved under a bed. So that's where the mess went, you think,
feeling a bit more comfortable. You sit between Phillipe and Jess.

"We're short one girl," gripes Phillipe, edging away from you.

"Omagod, we got a Math wiz over here. Be patient," says Shaunte, her eye
roll somehow making it into her tone of voice.

A toilet flushes, and Mia walks in. You immediately burn hot, and you
both avoid eye contact. Phillipe motions her towards the open spot
between you.

"It's okay, I got my cootie shot."

The girls giggle. Mia sits stiffly between you and Phillipe. Kimberly deals.
