**Lincoln (2012)**—[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443272/)

> Soo here's the latest movie review. We saw Lincoln tonight. I thought it was fantastic. The 2 and a half hours running time went quickly. Daniel Day Lewis looked and acted as if he were Lincoln.All the cast members were beleivable. I loved the congressional debates that were better than barbrawls because they were flinging verbal mud at each other,not fists.I love the way they &ldquo;made sauage&rdquo; by bribing the Dems to vote for the 13th. A very moving movie for me Love Dad.
