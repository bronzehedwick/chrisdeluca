So remember that screenshot I posted of a cartoon I said I was going to finish in a week a month ago? Well, I finally finished it. All two minutes of it. Here it is, and let me know what you think! Thanks.

Also, on a leukemic note, I have discovered the reason my platelet and neutrophil levels were so low was that 400 mg of Gleevec was too high a dose for my body, and hence the stuff zapped my bone marrow so it is currently not making much of anything. My reds, whites, platelets, neutrophils, and a half score of others are all really low.

However, not to worry, as I&#8217;m currently off Gleevec for three weeks to let my bone marrow bounce back, and in the mean time I&#8217;m getting weekly infusions of platelets. After three weeks the docs will put me on a reduced dose, which shouldn&#8217;t toast my bones, and I&#8217;ll be able to be cancer-free _and_ have normal blood!

Until then, check out my little cartoon.
