This is what I've been reading this past week.

<!--more-->

+ [Four Temperaments and the Forms of Poetry](http://mypage.siu.edu/puglove/4.htm)<br>A thinky, verbose literary analysis of what ingredients writers bring to their work, and how those best interact. Focused pointedly on poetry, but I think it has value for anyone working creatively with the written word.
+ [Jessie Frazelle's Blog: Government. Medicine. Capitalism?](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/government-medicine-capitalism/)<br>What the software industry can learn from government and medicine, and generally good thoughts on management.
+ [Remembering The Grateful Dead's 'Wall of Sound': An Absurd Feat of Technological Engineering](https://enmoreaudio.com/remembering-the-grateful-deads-wall-of-sound-an-absurd-feat-of-technological-engineering/)<br>Another story about The Dead I didn't think I'd enjoy, but here we are.
+ [Write code that is easy to delete](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)<br>Great article on software design, but I think the broad principles are applicative to many creative fields, as well.


There it is, and here we are. Go forth.
