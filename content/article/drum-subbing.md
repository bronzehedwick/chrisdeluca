Good news! I have unearthed a video of me playing with one of my favorite bands of all time, _The Candy Apples_.

Never heard of them? Now you have.

I was introduced to their music back in 2005 by my college roommate Andy McCarthy, who is part of the band (guitar and vocals). The two videos below are taken from a live broadcast of _Thursday Nite Live_, which is Hofstra University&#8217;s very own sketch comedy show that I was the head writer of in college.

This show was taped in October 2008, the fall after I graduated, so it was pretty awesome to go back and play.

The reason why I got to play with them was that their regular drummer, Steve Beck, had another gig with another band, The Gypsy West (another great band), and couldn&#8217;t make the show. So five days prior I was asked, immediately said yes, and spent the three days preceding the show practicing the songs after work.

There&#8217;s the story. If you like the music, let me know and I&#8217;ll send you their albums.

Keep it funky!
