You are zoovac, a robotic clown in a stick, on earth. You are trying to take down the company, an evil corporation bent on world domination. You enter the back door of the company research laboratory searching for the rich kid. The kid is nowhere to be found. The only thing you find is a dead body lying next to a pile of papers and other junk. The kid was supposed to meet you at this spot, but he never showed up. He must have been killed by some kind of accident or something!

**> “The rich kid was my informant! Now I can’t count on his help. I’ll have to look around for clues for the whereabouts of The Shadow. “**

You don't know what to do now. You could go back home and tell your family that you were attacked by a monster while looking for The Shadow, but they might not believe you since it happened so long ago.

**> Search the room for footprints**

You walk over to the desk where you saw the boy sitting. There are no prints here, but there are several empty bottles near it. You think maybe he drank from them before getting killed? Maybe he left behind a bottle opener as well?

**> Sniff the bottles to see if they are poison.**

You open one of the bottles and sniff it. It smells like alcohol, but nothing else. You close it again and put it away. You are going to need more booze when you try to track down The Shadow.

**> Look for full bottles of alcohol**

You open another bottle and sniff it. It smells like alcohol, but nothing else. You close it again and put it away. You are going to need more booze when you try to track down The Shadow.

**> Take the bottle of alcohol**

You take the bottle of alcohol and drink half of it. That should get you drunk enough to pass out until you can find something that will wake you up later.

**> Wake myself up with some Pennzoil**

You start to feel sleepy and decide to wake yourself up with some Pennzoil. You grab a bottle of the stuff and pour a little into your hand. Then you throw the rest of it out the window, hoping that someone will catch it.

You decide to search for the rich kid's body since you want to make sure that he wasn't killed by accident. You head over to the lab where you first met him and check all the rooms. No sign of him though.

**> Mix chemicals in the lab to make a seeking potion.**

You mix some chemicals together in the lab and wait for a few hours. You then put the concoction into a vial and leave it outside in the woods. When night comes, you return to your house to let it cure itself.

**> Plug myself into the internet and do a search for the rich kid**

You plug yourself into the internet and do a search for the rich kid. Nothing comes up. You wonder what happened to him, so you go back inside your house and check his room. He is gone! Well at least you know now that he was murdered by The Shadow...

**> “Of course! It’s perfectly logical. I can’t find any trace of the rich kid and he’s not in the room I keep for him at my house, so 2 + 2 = 4, he was murdered by The Shadow. Simple. Now I just need to find The Shadow and avenge the rich kids death. “**

**> “Oh snap! Rich kid where were you?”**

You plug yourself into the internet and do a search for The Shadow. Nothing comes up either. You wonder what happened to him, so you go back inside your house and check his room again. This time he's nowhere to be found!

**> Leave my creepy glitched out house**

You leave the mansion with your new found knowledge of how murder works.

**> Use my knowledge of murder to track down the shadow.**

You use your newfound knowledge of murder to track down the shadow. You find that he lives in a mansion called The Shadow Manor, which is located deep underground. You enter the basement and look around until you see a door on the left side of the stairs leading to an elevator.

**> Roll over the the elevator and press the button for the bottom floor.**

You roll over the elevator and press the button for the bottom floor. You get off at level 1 and walk through a small tunnel to reach level 2. There are no shadows here though, so you head back upstairs to find out who killed Rich Kid?

**> Ask the janitor who killed the rich kid.**

You ask the janitor who killed Rich Kid. He tells you that he didn't kill him, but rather someone else did. He says that it was a guy named Mr. X, who is also in charge of security at The Shadow Manor. You follow this up by asking if Mr.

**> Go to Mr. X’s office.**

**> Knock down the door with my clown head.**

You knock down the door with your clown head. A loud noise causes you to drop your weapon and fall backwards onto the ground. You hear a voice call out "Whoa! Whoa! What the fuck are you doing?"

**> Zap him with my electric tool belt.**

You zap him with your electric tool belt. He screams and falls backward, but not before grabbing his knife and stabbing himself in the stomach. His blood splatters all over you.

**> “I learned something else about murder. “**

**> “The rich kid is avenged. God, I’m stupid.”**
