_I've been writing(ish?) stories via https://aidungeon.io,
a ML algorithm trained on text adventure games. [The first
was a fantasy](/article/chris-the-wizard), and this one is a detective
story. It gets weird._

You are Zorro, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and a
police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're
searching for fled to. Suddenly , you hear a gunshot.

"What was that?" you ask.

"A hunter shot another hunter," says the man who is now lying on the ground. "The other hunter was killed."

**\> “Who shot you good man?”**

"I don't know yet, but I'm going to find out," replies the man.

"Goodbye then," you reply.

 

You walk through the woods and come across a small cabin. Inside it is a woman with long brown hair and wearing a blue dress.

**\> “Hello madam, did you perchance see a man shoot another man just now?”**

"No, but I saw someone else come here dressed like this," she replies.

"Who was he?"

"He's a stranger to me, but I think he's your friend Jack."

"And what do you want of him?

**\> “Please tell me what you want of Jack”**

"Well, I want him to come back here with me so we can talk about something important."

"Is there anything important?"

"Yes, I need him to help me get rid of my husband."

"Your husband?

**\> “Is your husband the killer?”**

"No, not at all, he's just a neighbor who has been harassing me lately."

"Oh, well I'll be glad to help you, but I must warn you, if you kill him, I will never forgive you."

"Why should I trust you?"

**\> Flash her my badge**

"Look, I've got nothing against you, but I've heard bad things about you from some people. Please, please, let me go home with you, I promise I won't hurt you.

**\> “Alright you can come along, but I’m warning you, things could get rough. “**

She smiles and nods. She takes one look at you and knows she wants to go home with you. She runs inside the house and locks herself in the bathroom. The door opens up and you run outside.

"Come on let's go!" you shout.

**\> Follow the sound of the gunshot.**

You follow the noise of the gunshot. It sounds like it came from the direction of the cabin. You follow the sound of the gunshot and soon arrive at the cabin. There is no sign of anyone inside.

You walk into the cabin and find the woman sitting on the floor crying.

**\> “Why are you crying?”**

"Because I love you, but I'm afraid that you might hate me after what happened."

"Will you ever forgive me?"

"Of course I will, but I still feel guilty about what happened.

**\> “What happened?”**

**\> Carry the woman out of the cabin**

You put the woman down and take her hand.

"I'm sorry for what happened, I wish I had done more to stop you from killing him."

"Thank you, I don't know why I didn't see it then, but now I do.

**\> Cook some pasta**

"Can I have some water?"

"Sure, just sit over there by the fire."

You head over to the stove and start cooking some pasta.

"So how did your day go?"

"It went fine, thanks for asking.

**\> Serve her a bowl of pasta**

The woman looks at the bowl of pasta in front of her and starts eating.

"Thanks, I really appreciate this."

"Don't mention it, I was just happy to eat something nice for once."

**\> Tell her my long and boring backstory**

"Okay, so where were you born?"

"I was born in a small town called New Friesland. My family owned a general store there until they moved to a new location when I was young."

"Where does your father work?

**\> “My father works as the top Chicago crime boss, Whitey Bulger, and I’m a detective. Thanksgivings are awkward. “**

"That's not very interesting, can we talk about something else?"

"Well yes, but I’m having trouble concentrating."

"Alright, well I guess I should get back to my story."

**\> “Fair enough. Why did you murder your husband?”**

"He was an asshole. He cheated on me with another woman and he wouldn't let me see my daughter. That's all I want to say on the subject."

"How old are you?"

"Twenty-one."

"Do you have any siblings?"

**\> Search outside for footprints**

"There aren't any outside."

"Why not?"

"They're probably playing hide and seek or something."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes, because if they are, I won't be able to find them again."

"Goodbye."

**\> Sniff the dirt**

"Hmm, smells like someone's been here before."

"What do you mean?"

"I smell their scent."

"Really?"

"Yeah, I've smelled it before."

"Have you ever thought that maybe I am one of those people?"

**\> Taste the moss**

"This is weird, I think I'm tasting something poisonous."

"No, no, don't worry about it, you'll get used to it."

"But…but I haven't eaten anything since breakfast!

**\> Fart loudly and wave my hand in front of my noae**

"Fart!"

"Hahaha, yeah right."

"Oh come on, you know what I mean."

"You don't need to explain yourself to me."

"Fine, I'm sorry.
