This is a little comic idea I came up with months ago for a _Star Craft 2_ cartoon contest _Blizzard_ was running.

If you don&#8217;t know what Star Craft is, then you won&#8217;t get the joke&#8230;and even if you **do** know Star Craft, there&#8217;s a fair chance you won&#8217;t get the joke either. Needless to say the cartoon did not win, but it was a lot of fun to make. Pierre did the art, by the way (I can&#8217;t paint like that).
