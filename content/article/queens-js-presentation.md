I had the priviledge of giving a talk at [QueensJS](https://www.meetup.com/queensjs) last week. QueensJS is a wonderful JavaScript meetup, with a real diverse and welcoming crew of folks attending.

I was pretty nervous about doing the presentation; I've been on stage a lot before, but this was the first time everything I talked about had to make sense, and, one would hope, be valuble to technical folks. It ended up going fine, and people seemed to enjoy it.

My talk was on a point and click adventure game I am working on for the web. You can [check out my slides here](/presentation/dr-strangecode/).
