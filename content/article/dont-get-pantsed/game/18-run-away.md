This is worse than your worst nightmare; in your worst nightmare, you
had still played a Minor Threat song.

Escape is your only option.

You bolt for the back door, but your bass is still plugged in, yanking
you backwards. You spin, trying to keep from falling, your junk jiggling
problematically. You lose control, plopping on the floor, ass poking up,
facing the audience.

"I knew it," you hear Dylan Cizinski say from the crowd.

You've somehow made an impossibly horrible situation even more horrible.

Your life is over. :skull:
