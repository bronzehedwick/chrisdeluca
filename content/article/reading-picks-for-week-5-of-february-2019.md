I hope to publish these link round-ups weekly, but for this first one I
have a backlog of saved links, so this one has more links then will be
usual.

+ [Ong's Hat: The Early Internet Conspiracy Game That Got Too Real](https://gizmodo.com/ongs-hat-the-early-internet-conspiracy-game-that-got-t-1832229488)<br>If you're into reading about weirdo conspiracy theories, inter dimensional travel, and/or New Jersey, this is a must.
+ [Privacy vs "I have nothing to hide" - Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/privacy-vs-i-have-nothing-to-hide/)<br>Puts the importance of privacy in plain, effecting language.
+ [CERN 2019 WorldWideWeb Rebuild](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/)<br>Very cool recreation of the first web browser, written for NeXT.
+ [Prof. Dr. Style](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/prof-dr-style/)<br>A fun look at the very early web design, and how bullet-proof it is still.
+ [Was the Godfather of Soul murdered?](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/us/james-brown-death-questions/index.html)<br>Completely gripping, totally chilling. I was captivated.
+ [The Transitive Nightfall of Fatty Egg Rolls](https://web.archive.org/web/20160403133058/http://luckypeach.com/the-transitive-nightfall-of-fatty-egg-rolls/)<br>I'm strangely enthralled by this tale of bygone Deadhead egg rolls, from a bygone website.
+ [A brief history of wi-fi privacy vulnerabilities | Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/2019/01/15/a-brief-history-of-wi-fi-privacy-vulnerabilities/)<br>A fascinating look at one of the underpinnings of modern life.

There it is, and here we are. Go forth.
