_This is a piece I wrote for McSweeny's that I didn't think would
get published, but wanted to go through the process regardless. As
suspected, it was not published. Here it is, in all it's rejected
glory._

Cats have lived with humans for thousands of years, but their
behavior can still be baffling. The best method for understanding cat
personalities is the same as it is for humans: figuring out which
lifeless rocks were in the sky when they were born.

## Aries

Your Aries cat is energetic and headstrong, which is why he ruined your
couch. Drawn to competition, he excels at interpersonal struggles,
like stealing the neighbor cat's food. He can appear selfish, but only
because he has tunnel vision for his task at hand. That's why he seems
so disinterested in you when he's staring at dust.


## Tarus

Your Tarus cat is peaceful and non-combative, and other cats will beat
the ever living Christ out of him. Trusty and reliable, he will always
pee on the exact same spot on the carpet. Naturally seeking luxury, your
cat would never make it on the street. In fact, all street Tarus cats
are dead.


## Gemini

Feeling a deep need to be with others, your Gemini cat will make a habit
of barging in whenever you take a crap. A philosopher at heart, you
will often see your cat gazing out the window, pondering life's great
questions. Questions such as, "Will I get to kill that bird?"


## Cancer

Much like Vin Diesel, your Cancer cat is obsessed with family. Except
only metaphorically; cats are really territorial. Have you ever seen
two cats getting to know each other? It's brutal. But somewhere in her
heart, she thinks of them as family, even as she's ripping off an ear.


## Leo

The ur-cat, Leos do what cats do, but more. Lay around? Check. Eat?
Check. Hunt your shins? Check and check. In addition, Leos are very
courageous, and will barely run away from the vacuum.


## Virgo

Don't let the surface fool you - it may look like your Virgo cat
is doing nothing, but rest assured, inside, her mind is alive with
calculations and predictions. Yes, to you it looks like she has been
asleep for upwards of three days, but inside, she just did your taxes.
Trust me.


## Libra

Your cat craves balance above all else; can't have too much or too
little, everything has to be just right. Dry or wet? Felt or feather
toy? Petting or no? Whatever it is, you better get it God damn right.


## Scorpio

Scorpio cats are not aggressive on their own, but are quick to violence
if provoked. Like, if you look at them too long.


## Sagittarius

The symbol of Sagittarius is the centaur - half human, half horse - but
that's for humans. The cat version is half cat, half shetland pony. The
cat half is terrified of the pony half.


## Capricorn

Driven by ambition, your Capricorn cat will stop at nothing to achieve
things no cat has ever accomplished before. That's why she keeps
fighting the dog. One of these days, she's going to win, so separating
them is against the stars.


## Aquarius

Generous and dedicated, Aquarius cats are the philanthropists of the
feline world. This means they'll think twice before stealing the
neighbor cat's food. They'll still do it, but they'll think about it
first.


## Pisces

The symbol of Pisces is a fish, and all Pisces cats won't eat fish out
of self respect, even though they love it. The only way to get your
Pisces cat to eat fish is if she's hungry.
